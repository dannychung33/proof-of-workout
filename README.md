# proof-of-workout
got it working simply
Proof-of-Workout: the landing page

Concept:
Proof-of-workout is more than just an incredible name, it is a very cool concept with roots in the very nature of its infrastructure (blockchain!).  So of course, using ENS is a no-brainer.  Basic concept: Anyone can use an Ethereum wallet to upload a workout video where they say or show the "challenge words" that are hard-coded into the Smart Contract.  This "proves" they made the video workout, but the next step is decentralized governance by all users of the site who can Approve or Reject (X) each upload.  Once a workout gets enough Approvals, it unlocks the ability to mint a unique NFT Body (NFB) with random stats, named after their winning workout.  So names and titles are important, which is why further development should focus on more rewards for the voters and implementing a token & staking/pooling system to keep things fun and honest.  I want to help the world decentralize and get healthier!

Instructions:
At this stage in development, you‚Äôll need MetaMask. Currently deployed onto Polygon Mumbai network.

Thanks:
My family and friends for putting up with my constant attempts to relate everything to Blockchain.

Sponsored Feedback Sessions were an incredible source of guidance and clarity, helping me shape this project (enhancing and simplifying).

‚ÄúTeammates‚Äù who discussed and approved the concept with me, fueled my energy by agreeing to help, but ultimately ‚Äúlet‚Äù me do literally all of the coding, design, and deployment by myself üí™ thanks guys!
